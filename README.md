tabtodoview is a extension of the todo.txt format

Made by Andrew Witty

Designed to be used as an all-in-one task manager


Essentially the input text file delimits projects by indents, forming a tree.

Then they are sorted and presented, for instance on priority, or due date.

Additionally, some can be added to a separate toplist based on the usual +tags


##Usage
- Run tabtodoview with the text file input, and it generates the view file under [inputname]_ttv
